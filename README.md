# CYVDModel
This model explores how the symbiotic bacteria _Caballeronia_ affects the ability of the squash bug _Anasa tristis to vector _Serratia marcescens_ to squash plants. We do this by tracking 4 populations of squash bugs that vary by symbiont status and pathogen infection status. 

For more details about the system see [citation].

Here, we provide code necessary to replicate our analyses using the R package "sensobol."

Model equations can be found in Squash_bug_apographs3.c. If you are unable to compile the code from the C source file directly in R, you can load Squash_bug_apographs3.dll directly.
