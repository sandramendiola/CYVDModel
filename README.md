# CYVDModel
This model explores how the symbiotic bacteria _Caballeronia_ affects the ability of the squash bug _Anasa tristis to vector _Serratia marcescens_ to squash plants. We do this by tracking 4 populations of squash bugs that vary by symbiont status and pathogen infection status. 

For more details about the system see Mendiola, S. Y., N. M. Gerardo, D. J. Civitello. (2024). “Ecological modeling evaluates the potential impacts of symbionts on plant pathogen vectoring in field populations.” Ecological Modelling 487, 110541.doi: 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110541.

Here, we provide code necessary to replicate our analyses using the R package "sensobol."

Model equations can be found in Squash_bug_apographs3.c. If you are unable to compile the code from the C source file directly in R, you can load Squash_bug_apographs3.dll directly.
